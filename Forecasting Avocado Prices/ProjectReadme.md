### Challenge 14: Forecasting Avocado Prices

**Level:**  Medium

****Description:**** You are a data scientist asked to analyze an avocado dataset by your team. The task at hand is to pick a specific avocado type in the whole of the US and forecast its daily average prices. To do that, you should train, apply, and score an  [ARIMA model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average). Do you see any seasonality in the line plot or autocorrelation plots? Do you think a  [seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average#Variations_and_extensions)  would perform better? For your model, visualize forecasts and compute scoring metrics.
