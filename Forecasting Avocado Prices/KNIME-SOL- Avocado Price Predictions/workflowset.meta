The task at hand is to pick a specific avocado type in the whole of the US and forecast its daily average prices. To do that, you should train, apply, and score an <strong>ARIMA model</strong>. Do you see any seasonality in the line plot or autocorrelation plots? Do you think a <strong>seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)</strong> would perform better? For your model, visualize forecasts and compute scoring metrics.</p>
